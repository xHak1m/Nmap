# üîß Basic Nmap Commands

This section covers the most commonly used Nmap commands to help you get started with scanning hosts and networks.

> üí° Tip: Run Nmap with `sudo` for more accurate results on some scans.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Scan a Single Host

```
nmap 192.168.1.1
```

Scans the default top 1000 TCP ports on the target IP.

---

2Ô∏è‚É£ Scan Multiple Targets

```
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
nmap 192.168.1.1,2,3
```

You can scan multiple hosts by separating them with spaces or commas.

---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Scan an Entire Subnet

```
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```

Scans all 256 IPs in the subnet.

---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Scan Specific Ports

```
nmap -p 22,80,443 192.168.1.1
```

Scans only the specified ports.

---

5Ô∏è‚É£ Enable Verbose Output

```
nmap -v 192.168.1.1
```

Displays more details while scanning.

---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Do a Stealth SYN Scan (default)

```
sudo nmap -sS 192.168.1.1
```

Sends SYN packets to detect open ports without completing the TCP handshake.

---

7Ô∏è‚É£ Detect Operating System and Services

```
sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.1
```

Performs an aggressive scan: OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

---

8Ô∏è‚É£ Service Version Detection

```
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
```

Tries to determine the version of services running on open ports.

---

9Ô∏è‚É£ Output Results to a File

```
nmap -oN results.txt 192.168.1.1
```
