## 📦 Key Features

| Feature                   | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| Port Scanning        | Detects open TCP/UDP ports on a host |
| Service Detection    | Identifies services and versions (e.g., Apache, SSH) |
| OS Detection         | Attempts to identify the target's operating system |
| Scriptable           | Uses the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) for automation |
| Fast and Flexible    | Scales from quick scans to large network sweeps |

## 🧠 Why Use Nmap?

Nmap is powerful and flexible. Whether you're troubleshooting a network or testing security, Nmap gives you the tools to understand what's running, where, and how it's exposed.

Examples of use:
- Check which services are exposed on a server
- Scan an entire subnet to find live hosts
- Detect outdated or vulnerable software versions

## ⚠️ Legal Notice

> Only scan systems and networks that you own or have explicit permission to test. Unauthorized scanning can be considered illegal activity.
